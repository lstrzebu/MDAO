Airfoil.dat files need to be Selig format dat file

- can find these on airfoiltools.com

- I could only find half of the airfoil files Bruno gave me in selig format. The other two can be found on airfoiltools.com. Also try to obtain a NACA 0000 file for the tail.

RunDynamicStab is the interface that runs all the functions. It could be further condensed to a function of its own.
